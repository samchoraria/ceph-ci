>=15.2.1
--------

* Cephadm: There were a lot of small usability improvements and bug fixes:

  * Grafana when deployed by Cephadm now binds to all network interfaces.
  * ``cephadm check-host`` now prints all detected problems at once.
  * Cephadm now calls ``ceph dashboard set-grafana-api-ssl-verify false``
    when generating an SSL certificate for Grafana.
  * The Alertmanager is now correctly pointed to the Ceph Dashboard
  * ``cephadm adopt`` now supports adopting an Alertmanager
  * ``ceph orch ps`` now supports filtering by service name
  * ``ceph orch host ls`` now marks hosts as offline, if they are not
    accessible.

* Cephadm can now deploy NFS Ganesha services. For example, to deploy NFS with
  a service id of mynfs, that will use the RADOS pool nfs-ganesha and namespace
  nfs-ns::

    ceph orch apply nfs mynfs nfs-ganesha nfs-ns

* Cephadm: ``ceph orch ls --export`` now returns all service specifications in
  yaml representation that is consumable by ``ceph orch apply``. In addition,
  the commands ``orch ps`` and ``orch ls`` now support ``--format yaml`` and
  ``--format json-pretty``.

* Cephadm: ``ceph orch apply osd`` supports a ``--preview`` flag that prints a preview of
  the OSD specification before deploying OSDs. This makes it possible to
  verify that the specification is correct, before applying it.

>=15.2.3
--------

* RGW: The ``radosgw-admin`` sub-commands dealing with orphans --
  ``radosgw-admin orphans find``, ``radosgw-admin orphans find``,
  ``radosgw-admin orphans find`` -- have been deprecated. They have
  not been actively maintained and they store intermediate results on
  the cluster, which could fill a nearly-full cluster.  They have been
  replaced by a tool, currently considered experimental,
  ``rgw-orphan-list``.
